## 1. Introduction
This script is designed to simulate and visualize trajectories of a model based on different management scenarios. The model integrates equations using specific parameters and creates 3D plots of these trajectories. The user can select options, configure the simulation, and optionally save the output as an image.

## 2. Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the script:
```
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib argcomplete
```

## 3. Script Breakdown
### 3.1. Imports
The script starts by importing several Python modules and custom libraries:

- **ays_model** and **ays_general**: These contain model definitions and utility functions.
- **numpy**: Provides array operations.
- **scipy.integrate**: Used for numerical integration (solving differential equations).
- **scipy.optimize**: Provides optimization tools to find the zeros of functions.
- **matplotlib**: Used to generate 2D and 3D plots.
- **argparse** and **argcomplete**: Handle command-line arguments and auto-completion.

### 3.2. Global Variables
The script defines several global variables that are essential for the simulation. These include management options and parameters required for the model's operation.

### 3.3. Command-Line Interface
The script uses argparse to handle command-line arguments. The user can specify options for the simulation, including:
- **option**: Choose the management option (default is `aws.DEFAULT_NAME`).
- **mode**: Specify which parts to sample (options are `all` or `lake`).
- **num**: Define the number of initial conditions (default is 400).
- **draw_boundary**: Option to remove the boundary inside the plot.
- **save_pic**: Save the generated plot as an image file.
- **zero**: Compute the zero of the right-hand side in the S=0 plane.

### 3.4. Simulation Execution
The script generates random initial conditions and prepares the simulation for different management scenarios. It performs numerical integration using the defined parameters and generates a 3D plot of the trajectories.

### 3.5. Output
The generated plot can be displayed on the screen or saved as an image file based on the user's preference. The plot visualizes the trajectories of the model under different management options and conditions.

## 4. Conclusion
This script provides a useful tool for simulating and visualizing model trajectories under various management scenarios. Students can explore different options and parameters to understand the model's behavior better.
