- **ALL_SIGNALS** (`dict`): Maps the names of all signals (from the Python `signal` module) to their corresponding numeric codes. It allows for dynamic signal handling setup, where the software can register handlers for a variety of signals based on current needs or operational modes. This facilitates graceful shutdowns, interrupts, or other necessary responses to external system events. Excludes non-catchable signals and those irrelevant for standard signal handling. This dictionary is generated by surveying the `signal` module for all usable signals, mapping them from their string names to their corresponding numeric values as defined by the operating system.

- Maps signals like `SIGINT`, `SIGABRT`, etc., to their respective numerical identifiers.
- Excludes non-catchable signals and focuses on those relevant for application-level signal handling.

#### Functionality:

- **NUMBER_TO_SIGNAL** (`dict`): Provides a reverse lookup from signal numbers to their string identifiers, useful for logging and exception handling in signal management.
