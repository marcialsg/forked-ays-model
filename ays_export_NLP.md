## Overview

This document provides a detailed description of the Python script `ays_export.py`, designed for exporting data from simulation files into a human-readable text format. Aimed at students and professionals in environmental and sustainability studies, the script ensures compatibility with modern Python standards and helps manage data from AWS-TSM files effectively using established Python libraries for file and argument handling.

## Features and Functionality

### Python Version Compatibility
The script uses features from Python 3.x, ensuring forward compatibility through the use of the `__future__` module. Functions like updated division behavior and print functionality are specified to align with Python's newer versions.

### Module Imports
- **Custom and Third-Party Modules**: The script imports `ays_general` and `pyviability`, which are likely custom modules tailored to handle specific data related to AWS-TSM (Atmospheric Weather Systems - Time Series Model) and system sustainability assessment.
- **Argument Parsing**: Utilizes `argparse` and `argcomplete` for parsing command line arguments and providing auto-completion, improving the user's command-line interaction.

### Command Line Interface
The script configures a command-line interface allowing users to specify:
- An input file containing TSM data.
- An optional output file for saving the processed data.
- A `--force` option to overwrite existing output files if necessary.

### Safety Checks
- **File Overwrite Protection**: Confirms with the user before overwriting existing files unless overridden by the `--force` option.
- **Input/Output File Distinction**: Ensures that the input and output files are distinct to prevent accidental data loss.

### Data Processing
- **Header and Data Extraction**: Loads and formats both the header and data from the result file for better readability, using functions like `ays_general.load_result_file`.
- **Region-Specific Data Integration**: Dynamically includes data relevant to different regions using constants from `pyviability`.

### Output Formatting
- **Structured Header**: The header information is enclosed within hash signs (`#`) to demarcate it clearly from the data.
- **File Writing**: Uses `numpy.savetxt` to write the data to a text file, configured to handle array-like data structures neatly.

### Console Feedback
Prints progress messages during the file-saving operations, keeping the user informed of the ongoing processes.

## Conclusion

`ays_export.py` serves as an efficient tool for transforming simulation data into an accessible format, integrating well with environmental and sustainability projects. Its use of robust Python features and careful error handling make it an invaluable asset for data processing and analysis.
