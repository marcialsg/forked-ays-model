This text provides an in-depth explanation of ays_model.py, a Python script designed to simulate and analyze a model involving atmospheric carbon, economic output, and renewable knowledge. The script leverages Python 3 features for consistent behavior across Python versions and imports essential libraries like `numpy`, `warnings`, and `sys` for numerical operations, system checks, and compatibility issues. It incorporates multiple management strategies through a dictionary named `MANAGEMENTS`, which maps descriptive strategy names to short abbreviations for easier handling in code. These strategies, including "degrowth," "solar-radiation," "energy-transformation," and "carbon-capture-storage," reflect various approaches to sustainability and climate management. The script includes a dynamic function, `get_management_parameter_dict`, to adapt parameter sets to specific strategies, ensuring flexibility in exploring different scenarios. Additionally, it establishes parameters in `AYS_parameters` and `boundary_parameters` dictionaries, defining the model's behavior and sustainability thresholds. Functions like `AYS_sunny_PB`, `AYS_sunny_SF`, and `AYS_sunny_PB_SF` assess whether the system's state remains within desirable environmental and socio-economic boundaries, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of management strategies' impacts. Overall, the script supports decision-making and sustainability assessment by simulating complex interdependencies in environmental and economic systems.

The code begins by importing the `division` and `print_function` from the `__future__` library, allowing Python 3 features to be utilized in Python 2 for consistent behavior in division and print statements across both versions.

It then imports essential modules and functions from various libraries such as `ays_general`, `pyviability`, `numpy`, `warnings`, and `sys`, which offer tools for numerical operations, warnings, and system operations.

The script checks the current versions of Python and `pyviability` to ensure compatibility. If the Python version is below 3, a warning is issued, noting that the code has only been tested on Python 3. Similarly, if the `pyviability` version is 0.2.0 or below, a warning is issued to ensure the correct version is used.

An attempt is made to import the `numba` library, which is used for just-in-time compilation to enhance the performance of numerical functions. If `numba` is unavailable, a warning is issued, and the script continues without it.

A dictionary named `MANAGEMENTS` is defined, containing different management strategies and their respective abbreviations. This dictionary maps long descriptive names of management strategies to short abbreviations, making the code more readable and manageable when dealing with multiple strategies that may have complex or lengthy names. Here is what each entry represents:

1. **"degrowth": "dg"** - Maps the "degrowth" strategy to "dg". Degrowth involves reducing consumption and production for sustainability, often minimizing economic growth to preserve environmental resources.
2. **"solar-radiation": "srm"** - "Solar-radiation" is abbreviated as "srm", likely standing for Solar Radiation Management, which involves techniques to reflect sunlight back into space to cool the Earth and counteract global warming.
3. **"energy-transformation": "et"** - Maps "energy-transformation" to "et", indicating a focus on changing or converting energy systems, possibly transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like wind or solar power.
4. **"carbon-capture-storage": "ccs"** - Abbreviates "carbon-capture-storage" as "ccs". Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a technology aimed at capturing carbon dioxide emissions from sources like power plants and storing it underground to prevent it from entering the atmosphere.

The `MANAGEMENTS` dictionary facilitates the selection and application of different management strategies within the model. Using short abbreviations allows the script to efficiently reference and modify parameters associated with each strategy, making the code more concise and easier to maintain. These strategies may influence various parameters and calculations within the model, affecting outcomes related to atmospheric carbon, economic output, and renewable knowledge.

A function named `get_management_parameter_dict` is defined to retrieve a dictionary of parameters for a specific management strategy. This function copies the passed parameters and modifies them according to the selected management strategy. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the function works and its purpose:

### Purpose
The primary purpose of the `get_management_parameter_dict` function is to adapt a general set of parameters to a specific management strategy. Each strategy may require different parameter values to reflect its unique approach to managing atmospheric carbon, economic output, and renewable knowledge.

### Function Breakdown

1. **Function Definition**
```python
def get_management_parameter_dict(management, all_parameters):
```
- The function takes two arguments: `management`, a string representing the chosen management strategy, and `all_parameters`, a dictionary containing all available parameters.

2. **Copy the Parameters**
```python
management_dict = dict(all_parameters) # make a copy
```
- A copy of the `all_parameters` dictionary is created, ensuring the original parameter set remains unchanged and allowing modification of the copy without affecting the source.

3. **Check for Default Management**
```python
if management == DEFAULT_NAME:
    return management_dict
```
- If the specified `management` is the default option (stored in `DEFAULT_NAME`), the function returns the copied parameter dictionary without modifications, as no strategy-specific changes are needed.

4. **Prepare to Modify Parameters**
```python
ending = "_" + MANAGEMENTS[management].upper()
changed = False
```
- Constructs a string `ending`, consisting of an underscore followed by the uppercase abbreviation of the selected management strategy. This string helps identify parameters needing modification for the chosen strategy.
- A boolean variable `changed` is initialized to `False` to track whether any parameters were found and modified for the selected strategy.

5. **Modify Parameters for the Selected Strategy**
```python
for key in management_dict:
    if key + ending in management_dict:
        changed = True
        management_dict[key] = management_dict[key + ending]
```
- Iterates over each key in the `management_dict`. For each key, it checks if there is a corresponding key with the strategy-specific `ending` in the dictionary.
- If such a key exists, it indicates a parameter specifically tailored for the chosen management strategy. The function updates the parameter value in `management_dict` with this strategy-specific value.
- The `changed` variable is set to `True` to indicate modifications were made.

6. **Error Handling**
```python
if not changed:
    raise NameError("didn't find any parameter for management option '{}' (ending '{}')".format(management, ending))
```
- If no parameters were modified (`changed` remains `False`), the function raises a `NameError`, alerting that no strategy-specific parameters were found for the selected management option, indicating a potential issue in the setup or naming of parameters.

7. **Return Modified Parameters**
```python
return management_dict
```
- Returns the modified parameter dictionary, now containing values tailored to the selected management strategy.

The `get_management_parameter_dict` function is a dynamic tool for adapting a set of general parameters to fit the requirements of specific management strategies. By leveraging this function, the script seamlessly switches between different strategies, ensuring all calculations and simulations reflect each approach's unique characteristics. This flexibility is essential for exploring various management scenarios and understanding their potential impacts on atmospheric carbon, economic output, and renewable knowledge.

The script initializes several dictionaries to store parameters for a model related to atmospheric carbon, economic output, and renewable knowledge. These parameters include rates, scaling factors, and boundaries for different variables.

The `AYS_parameters` dictionary is a curated collection of parameters used in a model simulating the dynamics between atmospheric carbon (A), economic output (Y), and renewable knowledge or energy stock (S). These parameters are fundamental to the model's equations and influence how the simulated system evolves over time. Here's a detailed explanation of each parameter and its role in the model:

1. **`"A_offset": 600`**
- Represents the pre-industrial level of atmospheric carbon, set as the baseline (A=0) for the model. It measures changes in atmospheric carbon relative to this historical baseline.

2. **`"beta": 0.03`**
- A rate parameter with units of 1/year. It likely represents the natural growth rate of economic output or a related factor in the model, crucial for determining how quickly economic output can grow naturally.

3. **`"beta_DG": AYS_parameters["beta"] / 2`**
- A modified version of `beta` used specifically for the "degrowth" management strategy, set to half the value of `beta`, reflecting a reduced growth rate consistent with degrowth principles.

4. **`"epsilon": 147.`**
- With units of USD/GJ (dollars per gigajoule), it represents the economic value or cost associated with energy use, used to convert between economic output and energy units in the model.

5. **`"rho": 2.`**
- A dimensionless parameter likely affecting the elasticity or responsiveness of certain model components. It may influence how renewable energy stock contributes to economic output or energy transformation.

6. **`"phi": 47.e9`**
- With units of GJ/GtC (gigajoules per gigaton of carbon), it represents the energy required to produce or sequester a unit of carbon, a key factor in determining the carbon efficiency of energy use.

7. **`"phi_CCS": AYS_parameters["phi"] * 4 / 3`**
- A modified version of `phi` for the "carbon-capture-storage" (CCS) strategy, accounting for a 25% increase in energy requirements due to carbon being removed as CO2 from the system.

8. **`"sigma": 4.e12`**
- Measured in GJ (gigajoules), it represents a threshold or saturation level for renewable knowledge or energy stock, possibly defining the maximum potential contribution of renewable energy to economic output.

9. **`"sigma_ET": AYS_parameters["sigma"] * .5 ** (1 / AYS_parameters["rho"])`**
- A modified version of `sigma` for the "energy-transformation" strategy, accounting for the influence of the `rho` parameter, likely modifying how energy transformation impacts the saturation level.

10. **`"tau_A": 50.`**
- With units of years, this parameter represents the timescale for changes in atmospheric carbon levels, influencing how quickly atmospheric carbon responds to changes in emissions or sequestration.

11. **`"tau_S": 50.`**
- Similar to `tau_A`, with units of years, it represents the timescale for changes in renewable knowledge or energy stock, affecting how quickly renewable energy resources can be developed or depleted.

12. **`"theta": AYS_parameters["beta"] / (950 - AYS_parameters["A_offset"])`**
- With units of 1/(yr GJ), `theta` represents a coupling factor between economic output and atmospheric carbon levels, possibly influencing how economic growth impacts or is impacted by carbon levels.

13. **`"theta_SRM": 0.5 * AYS_parameters["theta"]`**
- A modified version of `theta` for the "solar-radiation" management strategy, reflecting the potential impact of solar radiation management on the relationship between economic output and atmospheric carbon.

### Conclusion
The `AYS_parameters` dictionary provides a comprehensive set of parameters defining the model's behavior. Each parameter plays a specific role, influencing how atmospheric carbon, economic output, and renewable knowledge interact. Adjusting these parameters allows the model to simulate different scenarios and management strategies, providing insights into potential outcomes and guiding decision-making processes in addressing environmental and economic challenges.

The script sets up a grid of parameters to define the space in which the model operates, defined by boundaries and scaling parameters for different variables.

The `boundary_parameters` dictionary specifies threshold values defining the boundaries within which the system is considered to operate desirably. These parameters are crucial for assessing whether the system's state is within acceptable or sustainable limits from environmental and socio-economic perspectives. Here's a detailed explanation of each parameter and its significance:

1. **`"A_PB": 945 - AYS_parameters["A_offset"]`**
- **Description**: Represents the planetary boundary for atmospheric carbon levels. The planetary boundary concept refers to limits within which humanity can safely operate, avoiding significant environmental degradation or destabilization.
- **Calculation**: The value `945` corresponds to a specific atmospheric carbon threshold, likely in parts per million (ppm) or gigatons of carbon (GtC). By subtracting `AYS_parameters["A_offset"]` (600), the permissible increase in atmospheric carbon from pre-industrial levels is calculated. This subtraction aligns the boundary with the modeling framework where A=0 corresponds to pre-industrial levels.
- **Significance**: Evaluates whether atmospheric carbon levels in the model remain below a critical threshold that could lead to harmful climate change. Staying within this boundary is crucial for maintaining climate stability.

2. **`"W_SF": 4e13`**
- **Description**: Represents the social foundation threshold for economic output. The social foundation concept refers to the minimum level of economic activity necessary to ensure social well-being and development.
- **Units**: The value `4e13` is expressed in USD, likely representing the Gross World Product (GWP) or a related economic measure needed to sustain basic human needs and societal functions globally.
- **Significance**: Evaluates whether economic output in the model exceeds a minimum threshold necessary to support human welfare and development. Maintaining economic output above this level is vital for achieving social equity and prosperity.

### Role in the Model
The `boundary_parameters` are used within the model to check if the current state is within these defined boundaries. These checks may be part of functions like `AYS_sunny_PB`, `AYS_sunny_SF`, and `AYS_sunny_PB_SF`, which determine whether the system's state is within the planetary boundary, social foundation, or both. Such evaluations are essential for:

- **Sustainability Assessment**: Ensuring the system operates within environmental and socio-economic limits, promoting long-term sustainability.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Exploring the effects of different management strategies and their ability to maintain the system within desirable boundaries.
- **Decision Support**: Providing insights into the feasibility and implications of various policy or management decisions aimed at achieving environmental and social goals.

By incorporating `boundary_parameters`, the script aligns its simulations with broader sustainability and equity objectives, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of complex interdependencies between environmental and economic systems.

A function named `globalize_dictionary` is defined to make the values of a given dictionary available as global variables in the specified module.

The script defines several functions to describe the right-hand side of a system of differential equations representing the model. These functions calculate the rate of change of atmospheric carbon (A), economic output (W), and renewable knowledge (S) based on various parameters.

The functions `AYS_sunny_PB`, `AYS_sunny_SF`, and `AYS_sunny_PB_SF` check whether the system's state is within certain desirable boundaries, referred to as "planetary boundary" and "social foundation."

### Functions Detailed Explanation
These functions evaluate whether the state of the system, as represented by the model, falls within desirable or acceptable boundaries based on environmental and socio-economic criteria. Let's elaborate on each function:

### 1. `AYS_sunny_PB`
